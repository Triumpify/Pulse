## üë®‚Äçüíº Admin Functions

### Modify Exercise Calories
Only the fitness coach (contract deployer) can adjust point values:

```clarity
(contract-call? .fitchain modify-exercise-calories "workout" u15)
```

**Parameters:**
- `exercise-type`: Must be "workout", "challenge", or "wellness"
- `new-cals`: Point value (capped at 1000)

## üìà Fitness Score System

### Point Allocation
- **Workouts**: 10 points per session
- **Challenges**: 5 points per victory
- **Wellness Goals**: 15 points per achievement

### Score Degradation
Your fitness score gradually decreases based on inactivity:
- Degradation factor = inactive blocks √∑ 1000
- Encourages consistent engagement with the platform
- Prevents indefinite score accumulation without activity

## üèóÔ∏è Data Structure

### Athlete Stats
```clarity
{
    fitness-score: uint,      // Total accumulated points
    workouts-done: uint,      // Number of workouts completed
    challenges-won: uint,     // Number of challenges won
    last-session: uint,       // Block height of last activity
    wellness-goals: uint      // Number of wellness goals achieved
}
```

### Exercise Points
```clarity
{
    exercise: string-ascii 24,  // Exercise type identifier
    calories: uint              // Point value for the exercise
}
```
